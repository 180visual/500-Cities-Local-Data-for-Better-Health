# Visualization of 500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health
This project aims to visualize the public health data from 500 cities in the US. We attempt to understand the most demanding public health problem so as to better inform the public, medical practitioners as well as policy makers.

## Data Source
We obtain the public available dataset "500_Cities__Local_Data_for_Better_Health__2018_release.csv" from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health-b32fd).

Description: This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2018 release. This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.
